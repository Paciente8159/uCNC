# Adding custom modules to µCNC

__IMPORTANT NOTE__: _Version 1.7 implemented breaking changes to modules declarations. Please check the modules releases to get the right modules for your version [repository](https://github.com/Paciente8159/uCNC-modules)_

__NOTE__: _Version 1.4.6 implemented changes to module initialization. Also additional modules were moved to a new [repository](https://github.com/Paciente8159/uCNC-modules)_

µCNC has implemented a module system that allows the user to perform custom actions that get executed in an event/delegate fashion style similar to what is done with C#. Multiple callbacks functions can be attached to the same event.
These modules can be quite useful and perform several things like adding custom custom gcodes to perform actions, or modifying IO states if a given condition is verified.
µCNC already has a few useful modules like PID controller, Encoder module, TMC drivers support and custom G/M code support.
Version 1.8 also introduces the concept of simple hooks. These hooks are simple function pointers that execute the assigned callback at that time. They are usually used inside interrupt service routines and provide a way to extend ISR's with small extra code blocks to perform certain tasks. Unlike events, simple hooks can only run a single callback. The active callback is the last one to attach to any give hook.

## µCNC existing events/delegates

Without having to modify core code inside µCNC it is possible to listen to several already existing events. Here is a list of current events:

__NOTE__: Not all event hooks might be listed here. To find all available event hooks declarations, do a search on all files (on VSCode in Windows it's Ctrl+Shift+F) of the project of `DECL_EVENT_HANDLER`. You can also search for the `EVENT_INVOKE` to see what argument is being passed to the event handler.

| cnc_reset | NULL | ENABLE_MAIN_LOOP_MODULES | Fires when µCNC resets |
| rtc_tick | NULL | ENABLE_MAIN_LOOP_MODULES | Fires every millisecond. This code runs inside the RTC interrupt. Do not run long routines here. This is for time critical (periodic) tasks. |
| cnc_dotasks | NULL | ENABLE_MAIN_LOOP_MODULES | Fires on the main loop running. Any repeating task should be hooked here |
| cnc_io_dotasks | NULL | ENABLE_MAIN_LOOP_MODULES | Fires on the main IO loop running. This is similar to cnc_dotasks, the main difference is that this task will run also during delays |

| mc_line_segment | motion_data_t* | ENABLE_MOTION_CONTROL_MODULES | Fires when a line segment is about to be sent from the motion control to the planner. Arg is a pointer to a motion_data_t struct with the current motion block data |

Each of these events exposes a delegate and and event that have the following naming convention:

`<event_name>_delegate` -> type of a function pointer that defines the function prototype to be called by the event handler 
`<event_name>_event` -> pointer to the event that contains all the subscribers that are going to be called by the event handler
`event_<event_name>_handler` -> the event handler that is called inside the core code and calls and executes every subscriber callback

For example `cnc_dotasks` exposes `cnc_dotasks_delegate` and `cnc_dotasks_event` that will enable to create an attach a listener that gets called when the event executed inside the core code. This is done by the call to `event_<event_name>_handler` inside `cnc_dotasks` main loop function.

All delegates are of type `bool (*delegate_function_pointer) (void* args)`. All functions should reply with a `EVENT_CONTINUE`(false) or `EVENT_HANDLED`(true) to the handler. By default the event handler propagates the event to all the registered listeners until one of them replies with `EVENT_HANDLED`, at which point the handler prevents further propagation and resumes execution.

In most events the input argument is `NULL`. The exceptions are:

## µCNC existing hooks

These are the list of available hooks inside 

__NOTE__: Not all simple hooks may be listed here. To find all available simple hooks declarations, do a search on all files (on VSCode in Windows it's Ctrl+Shift+F) of the project of `DECL_HOOK`. You can also search for the `HOOK_INVOKE` to see what argument is being passed to the simple hook handler.

## modules.h and events 

`src/module.h` exposes a few handy macros that make event listeners, or custom events creations easy.

### event creation

To create custom event handlers these macros are available:

`DECL_EVENT_HANDLER(name)`

`WEAK_EVENT_HANDLER(name)`

`DEFAULT_EVENT_HANDLER(name)`

To create custom event listeners these macros are available:

`CREATE_EVENT_LISTENER(name, handler)`

`ADD_EVENT_LISTENER(name, handler)`

There are also a few other usefull macros that make module initialization and declaration easier. These are:

`DECL_MODULE(name)`

`LOAD_MODULE(name)`

As mentioned all events run a default calback handler that runs through all the listeners or shortens the execution if one of the listeners responds with a `EVENT_HANDLED`.

This behaviour can be modified with a custom callback function that can be declared using:

```
OVERRIDE_EVENT_HANDLER(name){
	// your custom code here
}
```
This is usefull if you want to to make a listener the only one that is able to listen to an event or bypass the event handler processing with some custom code.

## Creating a new custom event listener

Creating a new event listener is easy. All current modules are placed inside the `src/modules` directory but it's not mandatory. It's just a matter of having them organized.
If you place them in other places the only difference is the `#includes` directives should be updated since they use relative paths.

Also new modules should be initialized inside the `load_modules` function in module.c. This is not mandatory. It's a matter of keeping code organized and insure that the function calls are done in the correct order. Due to Arduino IDE limitations (not supporting folders) in the way you can access and modify source that is not in the same directory as the .ino file, different ways of including custom code can be adopted to make it work.

Let's look at an example in the Arduino IDE environment by creating and attaching and event listener to `cnc_dotasks`.

Add a new file .c to uCNC directory (same has uCNC.ino) and paste this code

```
// include cnc.h relative path
#include "src/cnc.h"

// preprocessor check if module is enabled
#ifdef ENABLE_MAIN_LOOP_MODULES

// custom code listener callback implementation
// all callbacks must be of type bool (*function_pointer) (void*)
bool my_custom_code(void* args)
{
    // do something

	// in this case we will return EVENT_CONTINUE to allow event to propagate to other listeners
	return EVENT_CONTINUE;
}

// create a listener of type cnc_dotasks
CREATE_EVENT_LISTENER(cnc_dotasks, my_custom_code);
#endif

// you only need to add the event listener to the event handler
// you can either call the ADD_EVENT_LISTENER inside the main µCNC initialization code 
// or you can create a module initialization function and call it inside the main µCNC initialization code. The advantage of the latest is that you can have multiple event listeners you want to attach to multiple events and perform other loading actions and that way, you perform this in one call.
// Here is an example

DECL_MODULE(my_custom_module){
#ifdef ENABLE_MAIN_LOOP_MODULES
	// attach the listener
	ADD_EVENT_LISTENER(cnc_dotasks, my_custom_code);
#endif
}
```

This created the event listener that is of type `cnc_dotasks`. The only thing left to do is to attach it so that it gets called when `cnc_dotasks` is fired.

In the uCNC.ino it's just a matter of adding the listener to the event like this:

Open uCNC.ino

```
#include "src/cnc.h"

int main(void)
{
    //initializes all systems
    cnc_init();

    // add the listener to cnc_dotasks
    // ADD_EVENT_LISTENER(cnc_dotasks, my_custom_code);

	// or instead of calling the listener you can call the module initializer that does that task like this
	LOAD_MODULE(my_custom_module);

    for (;;)
    {
        cnc_run();
    }
}
```

That's it. Your custom function will run inside the main loop.

## Creating a new custom event

Creating custom events inside the core code is also easy.

First you need to declare the event inside one of the .h core code files

For example lets create an event to be fired when µCNC enters alarm any alarm state, that will be called inside function `void cnc_alarm(int8_t code)` in `cnc.c`

We start by declaring a new event called *cnc_alarm* (in our example inside `cnc.h`) like this

```
DECL_EVENT_HANDLER(cnc_alarm);
```

Now (in our example inside `cnc.c`) we need to add the event callback that will check if it as event listeners and call them one by one. To create a default event listener we just need to add this code:

```
WEAK_EVENT_HANDLER(cnc_alarm)
{
	DEFAULT_EVENT_HANDLER(cnc_alarm);
}

```

*Again remember. You can make a module take hover this event callback (disabling all existing listeners of this event by creating and override callback with `OVERRIDE_EVENT_HANDLER` like showned above).*

The only step left is to actually add the callback inside the core code to be executed. In this case let's call it inside our `void cnc_alarm(int8_t code)` function like this:

```
void cnc_alarm(int8_t code)
{
	cnc_set_exec_state(EXEC_KILL);
	cnc_stop();
	cnc_state.alarm = code;
#ifdef ENABLE_IO_ALARM_DEBUG
	proto_print(MSG_FEEDBACK_START);
	proto_print(__romstr__("LIMITS:"));
	proto_print_int(io_alarm_limits);
	proto_print(__romstr__("|CONTROLS:"));
	proto_print_int(io_alarm_controls);
	proto_print(MSG_FEEDBACK_END);
#endif

	// we add our callback here
	// in this callback we will pass to the listeners our error code
	// since all event callback argument is of type void* (void pointer) we send the pointer to the error code like this

	EVENT_INVOKE(cnc_alarm, &code);
}

```

That's it. Every time there is an alarm, the event handler will run and execute the listener callbacks.
